			My journey with IT began at an early age, I was always infatuated with the latest video game consoles and loved to play around on our household computer. 
			Building from here, I began making small games and animations within Scratch. Inevitably I had learnt my first programming language, python, 
			and continued my studies within the subject. Eventually, I found myself on holiday learning JavaScript; 
			my dedication and passion for this subject had extended beyond just my academic work. </p>
